## About Me

My name is Peter Maximilian Fortunato. 

I am from Kansas, the Sunflower State, whose motto is "Ad astra per aspera" or, "To the stars through difficulty". It doesn't have to be difficult, but rather tidy and organized, and the stars will align (more or less).

Here at Solplots, I am committed to enabling everyone to see data and stories for themselves, to reproduce and share insights that are not just actionable but also grounded in clarity and mutual respect.
