Explore the permanent art collection in MTA stations across New York City. This is intended to demonstrate how quickly one can spin up an app that enables quick and easy exploration of a data set from New York State's Open Data Portal. The code will be published to GitHub shortly.

To identify the cover photo, it is the piece *The Habitat for the Yellow Bird* by Takayo Noda, and is displayed in the Sutter Ave station on the L line of the NYC Subway.
